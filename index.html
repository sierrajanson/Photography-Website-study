<!-- portfolio websites:
have "call to action": email easy and accessible to copy (
  don't talk away from the page as well
)

when showing case examples, show them on the page, don't make the interviewer have to click away from the page

ui/ux design, negative space says a lot 

make title/message biggest, not name (important thing is what you do,
not who you are to people hiring you) 

don't play sound immediately when you load the page, or at all 

tell me about your project (for contact) -->


<!-- 
LEARNED FROM PROJ:
1. tilting name title looks really cool
2. unsplash photos are great, and then you can upload it to canva to get a nice color pallete for web;
and THEN you can upload it to image color picker to get more colors in hex if necessary
3. writing out what i want a website to look like, and marking it with the tags
that i'll use for html/css is really helpful

IMPROVE:
1. spacing (flex/grid knowledge)
2. dynamic website (i find myself hardcoding or just changing things to see if they will align in the 
way i want them to)
3. organization

IDEAS:
1. learn how to take own photos 
2. learn how to edit stock photos to fit a theme for a website (and other design things)
-->


<!-- 
IMMEDIATE:
1. put copyright info in footer & put footers on every page :)
2. put placeholders input and disclaimer that it's just for demonstrative purposes
3. form validation (put something in the fields if you want to submit)
4. form submitted successfully text below button!

EXTRA:
1. some indiciation to show what page is on
2. slideshow when click on images 

NICE:
1. media queries to make website accessible for mobile too
2. figure out button arranging and image grid arranging (should do grid for next web proj) (or put in about)
3. organize CSS
4. fix color for grid (not the right shade of grey)
5. add image shadow(s)
